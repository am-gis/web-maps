Steps to add a new web map (same process applies for updating an existing web map in this repository except start at Step 2):

  1.  Rename qgis2web folder appropriately and add to this repository (T:\github\web-maps)
  2.  Once added/updated gh-pages will need to have changes committed. GitHub Desktop recommended for following steps. Can be downloaded here: https://desktop.github.com/
  3.  Commit changes to main with some description of activity e.g. "Added webMapNameGoesHere" or "Updated index.html for webMapNameGoesHere"
  4.  Once completed, push origin (Ctrl+P)
  5.  Switch to gh-pages branch and update from main Ctrl+Shift+U)
  6.  Again, once completed, push origin (Ctrl+P)
  7.  Close GitHub Desktop

It may take a moment to for changes to be reflected, but once the above steps have been completed, view web map at: am-gis.github.io/web-maps/webMapNameGoesHere
